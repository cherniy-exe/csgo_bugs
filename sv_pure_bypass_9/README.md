## sv\_pure bypass \#9

A slightly different exploit - works only on non-official servers. That means it works on any community server, ESEA, Faceit, Esportal etc.

### Steps

1. Extract the [`materials.zip`](materials.zip) file inside the `csgo` directory.
2. Launch CS:GO.
3. Load an offline map you will be connecting to later.
4. Connect to any non-official server. It can run `sv_pure 1` - it does **not** have any effect!
5. Profit!
